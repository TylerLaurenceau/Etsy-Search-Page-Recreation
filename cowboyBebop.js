 Here are a few important ones:   \n\nATTN INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:  \n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665  CUSTOMS CHARGES: PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.  Please remember that I am NOT responsible for your custom charges as they are **not** included in shipping costs.  \n\nI understand that international shipping costs alone *before* you even add in the extra customs charges, fees, etc., are very expensive; however, I charge the absolute lowest I *possibly* can when you factor in the cost of shipping tubes, labels, labor, etc.  I actually undercharge for international shipping by a small amount, so please understand that I don&#39;t like the pricey international shipping anymore than you do, but unfortunately there&#39;s not much to be done about it. :(  So, I&#39;m asking that you please remember to factor in the customs\/VAT\/etc. charges in when deciding whether you would like to go ahead and place your order and that you are responsible for those upon your item&#39;s arrival.  I reeeeally wish it was cheaper to ship internationally. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \n\n\u2665  If an item seems stuck, or if there was a mistake with your order, \u2665\u2665 PLEASE MESSAGE ME BEFORE OPENING A CASE OR LEAVING NEGATIVE FEEDBACK \u2665\u2665   I am super easy to work with and want to do what I can to rectify the situation and make sure you are happy with your orders! :)  I also understand that things get lost sometimes--and I have no problem replacing things that are obviously just lost.  Please do not open a case against me before even contacting me, I promise I don&#39;t bite!  Just message me! I want to do all I can to make sure that you&#39;re happy with your order!  &lt;3 \n\n\u2665  Please keep in mind it can take up to 10 business days to ship orders (**This does NOT include time spent in transit**)!  Generally we ship them within 5 days, but occasionally we must order specific stock, or we might be at a convention, which adds a few days onto the time it takes to ship out orders. And then the actual amount of time it takes to arrive at your location depends on where you are.  Again, orders are shipped from here within 2-10 days depending on certain factors (though we typically ship out within 5 days).  After that, the amount of time it spends in transit to get to you depends on where you&#39;re located.  Most things arrive domestically within 2-6 days after it&#39;s been shipped out.     \n\n\u2665  If you need faster shipping PLEASE message me before placing your order--do not include a note requesting faster shipping, as I may not see that or be able to do that, despite you having already placed an order.  \n\n\u2665  If tracking says an item was delivered but you can&#39;t find it, you unfortunately will have to take it up with USPS and report the package as stolen\/try to figure out where it went\/have them try and fix a misdelivery.  We can do nothing on our end, as once we ship it, it is out of our hands. Again, we don&#39;t have any other special way to contact the USPS or anything that&#39;s different than what you&#39;re able to do, sadly.  They&#39;re the ones you will have to contact if your order is missing after being delivered.  We are usually happy to replace items lost in the mail as long as you&#39;ve contacted USPS about it and tried to locate it, and it&#39;s not a recurring thing.  \n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\u2665*\u2665~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~\n\nThank you again for visiting my print store!

ARE THEY SIGNED?\nThere is no watermark in the bottom-right corner of our prints whereas in the images, there is an Etsy url to prevent image theft. Also, colors may vary slightly between the actual work and the image on your screen.  Every monitor is different and some are much brighter than others, so we cannot help if they vary somewhat.\n\nIn regard to signing prints:  all prints are, by default, signed on the back. If you&#39;d rather have a note included, custom signature or front signature (or all of the above!) let us know in a purchase note or message.\n\nDO YOU DO CUSTOM ART?  TRADES? REQUESTS?\nWe only do custom work when advertised. We do not do unsolicited commissions, alterations to our work, or anything of that nature. Inquiries will likely not be responded to.\n\nIn regard to trades: generally not. If I approach you about a trade, then that&#39;s a different story, but generally, the answer is no.\n\nFor requests: my plate is honestly too full for suggestions ATM. One exception is if you subscribe to my Patreon, however! Check out http:\/\/www.patreon.com\/meganlara for more details.\n\nDO YOU OFFER ANY SPECIAL COUPON CODES?\nYes! Stay tuned to our Facebook page (http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mLARAart) and Twitter (https:\/\/twitter.com\/mLARAart) for special codes. Here&#39;s a freebie, though: use the code BIGSPENDER on orders over $100 for free domestic shipping!\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR SHIPPING TIMES?  DO YOU DO RUSH SHIPPING?\nWe *might* be able to rush shipping, but PLEASE message me to ask before placing your order. Normal domestic orders are sent First Class via USPS, and take an average of 2-10 days to ship depending on whether or not we have to order the print or have it on hand (**this does NOT include time spent in transit)** Generally we ship them within 5 days, but occasionally we must order specific stock, or we might be at a convention, which adds a few days onto the shipping time.\n\nWe tend to ship on Mondays and Fridays, though this is subject to change without notice. If you need something shipped ASAP, please send us a message.\n\nWHAT DO I DO IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MY ORDER\/SOMETHING IS MISSING\/THE TRACKING ISN&#39;T UPDATING\/ETC.?\n\u2665\u2665 PLEASE MESSAGE ME BEFORE OPENING A CASE \u2665\u2665 I am super easy to work with and want to do what I can to rectify the situation and make sure you are happy with your orders! :)  I also understand that things get lost sometimes--and I have no problem replacing things that are obviously just lost.  \n\nPlease do not open a case against me before even me, I promise I don&#39;t bite!  Just message me! &lt;3 But please give me 1-3 days to respond!  I promise I will! The only messages I don&#39;t respond to are spam, or--if we&#39;re really busy--some things that are already mentioned in the FAQ (like asking if I do custom orders and stuff).  Everything else will be responded to!  :D\n\nI ENTERED THE WRONG ADDRESS AFTER PLACING MY ORDER AND I DIDN&#39;T REALIZE IT.  IT WAS RETURNED TO YOUR STORE AND I WOULD LIKE IT RE-SHIPPED.  WHAT CAN I DO?\nIf your order is returned to me due to any set of circumstances where you are at fault for the item being returned to sender (i.e. you refused to pay the customs\/VAT fees, incorrectly entered your address, neglected to pick it up in a timely fashion) and wish for me to re-ship it to you, you have two options available to you:\n\n* You can request that I re-ship it to you immediately once it&#39;s been returned to me--however, please note that you will have to pay the shipping charges again.\n\n* If, after seeing the cost of customs\/shipping again\/etc, you decide that it is more than you are willing to pay to have it re-shipped, and you no longer want the item(s) for that reason, you will be refunded the cost of your order MINUS the shipping costs.\n\nWILL YOU PLEASE SEND ME YOUR IMAGE&#39;S HIGH RESOLUTION FILES FOR X REASON?\nI will absolutely NOT send high resolution files to you for you to bypass having things shipped or for any other reason.  Nope nope nope.\n\nWHOLESALE AVAILABILITY\nWe are available for wholesaling. Message us for details! :)\n\nIN REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL PACKAGES CUSTOMS CHARGES, VAT, ETC.\nCustoms\/VAT\/etc. are your responsibility! They are not included in the price\/are not paid by me.  Please remember that I am not responsible for your custom&#39;s charges as they are **not** included in shipping costs.  Please consider this before placing your order!  It is your responsibility to figure out customs and things before you order.\n\nWHY IS YOUR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING SO EXPENSIVE?\nI understand that international shipping costs--before you even add in the extra customs charges, fees, etc.--are very expensive; however, I charge the absolute lowest I *possibly* can when you factor in the cost of shipping tubes, labels, labor, etc.  I&#39;m actually slightly undercharging for international shipping, so please understand that I don&#39;t like the pricey international shipping any more than you do, but unfortunately there&#39;s not much to be done about it. :( I wish it was cheaper to ship internationally, but unfortunately I am already charging the bare minimum that I can without losing much money.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1480734346,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"I will be reopening the shop sometime this week or week and a half (I have to re-order most of my inventory)--so stay tuned!

Since it&#39;s 2016 and we don&#39;t yet have personal spacecraft or flying cars, you should consider upgrading your car&#39;s style with this license plate frame.\n\nNow available in plastic or metal variations, large text style measures 0.75&quot; tall, 10&quot; long and is center aligned. For a more subtle style choose small text (0.5&quot; text, 6.5&quot; long) that is right aligned. Standard text color is white but custom colors are available by request.\n\nAuto plate frames fit standard 6&quot; x 12&quot; (~15.25 x 30.5 cm) US and Canada license and vanity plates and may fit some international plates as well. Please be aware that it does cover a portion of the bottom of the plate. The plastic frame has 2 mounting holes so this frame will not fit a car that uses 4 bolts (such as a Volvo) without modification. \n\nThe black and chrome metal frames are designed to show as much of your plate as possible so it is slightly larger at 6 5\/8&quot; (168mm) and the bottom of the plate including the mounting holes will still be visible. Please check included pictures and\/or measure to ensure this will work on your vehicle before purchasing, and feel free to contact me with any questions. The metal frame should fit on a Volvo or any other car that uses 4 bolts or studs.\n\nMotorcycle plate frame comes only in a black metal finish and should fit standard 7&quot; x 4&quot; (~17.8cm x 10.2cm) state motorcycle plates with 5.75&quot; x 2.75&quot; (14.6cm x 7cm) distance between bolts. It may fit motorcycle plates with slight size and bolt variations but contact me with the dimensions of your plate if you want to check fitment.\n\nLicense plate frames are made to order and will ship within 1-3 business days, unless otherwise specified. If you need your order by a certain date please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me so I can confirm whether it will arrive in time.\n\n**Discounted metal plate frames have some minor cosmetic flaws and scratches. The scratches will not be visible from more than a few feet away once on your vehicle, but I would not recommend buying them as gifts due to the imperfections. Please don&#39;t hesitate to message me through etsy if you have any questions about these frames.**","creation_tsz":1486680243,"ending_tsz":1497044643,"original_creation_tsz":1384463776,"last_modified_tsz":1486680243,"price":"11.50","currency_code":"USD","quantity":10,"tags":["Cowboy Bebop","Bebop","See you space cowboy","Spike","anime","Faye","Ein","License plate","license plate frame","vanity plate","vanity plate frame"],"category_path":["Everything Else"],"category_path_ids":[68887416],"materials":["acrylic","metal","outdoor grade vinyl lettering"],"shop_section_id":14530255,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1486000660,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/169282345\/cowboy-bebop-see-you-space-cowboy?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":14097,"num_favorers":1404,"shipping_template_id":15820231373,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1895,"taxonomy_path":["Electronics & Accessories","Car Parts & Accessories","Car Accessories"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":525872642,"hex_code":"767677","red":118,"green":118,"blue":119,"hue":240,"saturation":0,"brightness":46,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1384463776,"listing_id":169282345,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/042\/0\/7548242\/il_75x75.525872642_ir59.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/042\/0\/7548242\/il_170x135.525872642_ir59.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/042\/0\/7548242\/il_570xN.525872642_ir59.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/042\/0\/7548242\/il_fullxfull.525872642_ir59.jpg","full_height":620,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":526086559,"hex_code":"868079","red":134,"green":128,"blue":121,"hue":32,"saturation":9,"brightness":52,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1384485808,"listing_id":169282345,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/7548242\/il_75x75.526086559_8ft4.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/7548242\/il_170x135.526086559_8ft4.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/7548242\/il_570xN.526086559_8ft4.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/7548242\/il_fullxfull.526086559_8ft4.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":525872640,"hex_code":"7F6467","red":127,"green":100,"blue":103,"hue":353,"saturation":21,"brightness":49,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1384463776,"listing_id":169282345,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/7548242\/il_75x75.525872640_q7dn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/7548242\/il_170x135.525872640_q7dn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/7548242\/il_570xN.525872640_q7dn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/7548242\/il_fullxfull.525872640_q7dn.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1333},{"listing_image_id":773828396,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1431959855,"listing_id":169282345,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/7548242\/il_75x75.773828396_g6gn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/7548242\/il_170x135.773828396_g6gn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/7548242\/il_570xN.773828396_g6gn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/7548242\/il_fullxfull.773828396_g6gn.jpg","full_height":369,"full_width":492},{"listing_image_id":779435489,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1432916903,"listing_id":169282345,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7548242\/il_75x75.779435489_g2i9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7548242\/il_170x135.779435489_g2i9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7548242\/il_570xN.779435489_g2i9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7548242\/il_fullxfull.779435489_g2i9.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":7548242,"shop_name":"SweetGraffix","user_id":27294037,"creation_tsz":1363746163,"title":"Custom vinyl graphics and nail art","announcement":"Welcome to Sweet Graffix! \r\n\r\nSweet Graffix specializes in a wide range of vinyl decals from car graphics to nail art.

Here are a few important ones:   \n\nATTN INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:  \n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665  CUSTOMS CHARGES: PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.  Please remember that I am NOT responsible for your custom charges as they are **not** included in shipping costs.  \n\nI understand that international shipping costs alone *before* you even add in the extra customs charges, fees, etc., are very expensive; however, I charge the absolute lowest I *possibly* can when you factor in the cost of shipping tubes, labels, labor, etc.  I actually undercharge for international shipping by a small amount, so please understand that I don&#39;t like the pricey international shipping anymore than you do, but unfortunately there&#39;s not much to be done about it. :(  So, I&#39;m asking that you please remember to factor in the customs\/VAT\/etc. charges in when deciding whether you would like to go ahead and place your order and that you are responsible for those upon your item&#39;s arrival.  I reeeeally wish it was cheaper to ship internationally. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \n\n\u2665  If an item seems stuck, or if there was a mistake with your order, \u2665\u2665 PLEASE MESSAGE ME BEFORE OPENING A CASE OR LEAVING NEGATIVE FEEDBACK \u2665\u2665   I am super easy to work with and want to do what I can to rectify the situation and make sure you are happy with your orders! :)  I also understand that things get lost sometimes--and I have no problem replacing things that are obviously just lost.  Please do not open a case against me before even contacting me, I promise I don&#39;t bite!  Just message me! I want to do all I can to make sure that you&#39;re happy with your order!  &lt;3 \n\n\u2665  Please keep in mind it can take up to 10 business days to ship orders (**This does NOT include time spent in transit**)!  Generally we ship them within 5 days, but occasionally we must order specific stock, or we might be at a convention, which adds a few days onto the time it takes to ship out orders. And then the actual amount of time it takes to arrive at your location depends on where you are.  Again, orders are shipped from here within 2-10 days depending on certain factors (though we typically ship out within 5 days).  After that, the amount of time it spends in transit to get to you depends on where you&#39;re located.  Most things arrive domestically within 2-6 days after it&#39;s been shipped out.     \n\n\u2665  If you need faster shipping PLEASE message me before placing your order--do not include a note requesting faster shipping, as I may not see that or be able to do that, despite you having already placed an order.  \n\n\u2665  If tracking says an item was delivered but you can&#39;t find it, you unfortunately will have to take it up with USPS and report the package as stolen\/try to figure out where it went\/have them try and fix a misdelivery.  We can do nothing on our end, as once we ship it, it is out of our hands. Again, we don&#39;t have any other special way to contact the USPS or anything that&#39;s different than what you&#39;re able to do, sadly.  They&#39;re the ones you will have to contact if your order is missing after being delivered.  We are usually happy to replace items lost in the mail as long as you&#39;ve contacted USPS about it and tried to locate it, and it&#39;s not a recurring thing.  \n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\u2665*\u2665~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~\n\nThank you again for visiting my print store!

Sellers don't receive your credit card information.\n- Visa\n- MasterCard\n- American Express\n- Discover\n- PayPal\n- Apple Pay\n- SOFORT Bank Transfer\n- iDEAL\n- Etsy Gift Card","policy_shipping":"PROCESSING TIME\nThe time I need to prepare an order for shipping varies. For details, see individual items.\n\nESTIMATED SHIPPING TIME\nCanada: 1 - 2 weeks\nGermany: 1 - 3 weeks\nNorth America: 1 - 2 weeks\nEurope: 1 - 3 weeks\n\nI'll do my best to meet these shipping estimates, but cannot guarantee them. Actual delivery time will depend on the shipping method you choose.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES FEES\nBuyers are responsible for any customs or duties fees that may apply. Sellers aren't responsible for delays due to customs","policy_refunds":"I GLADLY ACCEPT RETURNS, EXCHANGES, AND CANCELLATIONS\nJust contact me within: 14 days of delivery\nShip returns back to me within: 30 days of delivery\nRequest a cancellation within: 1 hour of purchase\n\nTHE FOLLOWING ITEMS CAN'T BE RETURNED\nBecause of the nature of these items, unless they arrive damaged or defective, I can't accept returns for:\n- Custom or personalized orders\n- Perishable products (like food or flowers)\n- Digital downloads\n- Intimate items (for health\/hygiene reasons)\n- Items on sale\n\nCONDITIONS OF RETURN\nBuyers are responsible for return shipping costs.\nIf the item is not returned in its original condition, the buyer is responsible for any loss in value.\n\nQUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR ORDER?\nPlease contact me if you have any problems with your order.","policy_additional":"I will only use your shipping and billing address, and contact information\n- To communicate with you about your order\n- To fulfill your order\n- For legal reasons (like paying taxes)\n\nARE THE PRINTS IDENTICAL TO THE IMAGES SHOWN?  ARE THEY SIGNED?\nThere is no watermark in the bottom-right corner of our prints whereas in the images, there is an Etsy url to prevent image theft. Also, colors may vary slightly between the actual work and the image on your screen.  Every monitor is different and some are much brighter than others, so we cannot help if they vary somewhat.\n\nIn regard to signing prints:  all prints are, by default, signed on the back. If you&#39;d rather have a note included, custom signature or front signature (or all of the above!) let us know in a purchase note or message.\n\nDO YOU DO CUSTOM ART?  TRADES? REQUESTS?\nWe only do custom work when advertised. We do not do unsolicited commissions, alterations to our work, or anything of that nature. Inquiries will likely not be responded to.\n\nIn regard to trades: generally not. If I approach you about a trade, then that&#39;s a different story, but generally, the answer is no.\n\nFor requests: my plate is honestly too full for suggestions ATM. One exception is if you subscribe to my Patreon, however! Check out http:\/\/www.patreon.com\/meganlara for more details.\n\nDO YOU OFFER ANY SPECIAL COUPON CODES?\nYes! Stay tuned to our Facebook page (http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mLARAart) and Twitter (https:\/\/twitter.com\/mLARAart) for special codes. Here&#39;s a freebie, though: use the code BIGSPENDER on orders over $100 for free domestic shipping!\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR SHIPPING TIMES?  DO YOU DO RUSH SHIPPING?\nWe *might* be able to rush shipping, but PLEASE message me to ask before placing your order. Normal domestic orders are sent First Class via USPS, and take an average of 2-10 days to ship depending on whether or not we have to order the print or have it on hand (**this does NOT include time spent in transit)** Generally we ship them within 5 days, but occasionally we must order specific stock, or we might be at a convention, which adds a few days onto the shipping time.\n\nWe tend to ship on Mondays and Fridays, though this is subject to change without notice. If you need something shipped ASAP, please send us a message.\n\nWHAT DO I DO IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MY ORDER\/SOMETHING IS MISSING\/THE TRACKING ISN&#39;T UPDATING\/ETC.?\n\u2665\u2665 PLEASE MESSAGE ME BEFORE OPENING A CASE \u2665\u2665 I am super easy to work with and want to do what I can to rectify the situation and make sure you are happy with your orders! :)  I also understand that things get lost sometimes--and I have no problem replacing things that are obviously just lost.  \n\nPlease do not open a case against me before even me, I promise I don&#39;t bite!  Just message me! &lt;3 But please give me 1-3 days to respond!  I promise I will! The only messages I don&#39;t respond to are spam, or--if we&#39;re really busy--some things that are already mentioned in the FAQ (like asking if I do custom orders and stuff).  Everything else will be responded to!  :D\n\nI ENTERED THE WRONG ADDRESS AFTER PLACING MY ORDER AND I DIDN&#39;T REALIZE IT.  IT WAS RETURNED TO YOUR STORE AND I WOULD LIKE IT RE-SHIPPED.  WHAT CAN I DO?\nIf your order is returned to me due to any set of circumstances where you are at fault for the item being returned to sender (i.e. you refused to pay the customs\/VAT fees, incorrectly entered your address, neglected to pick it up in a timely fashion) and wish for me to re-ship it to you, you have two options available to you:\n\n* You can request that I re-ship it to you immediately once it&#39;s been returned to me--however, please note that you will have to pay the shipping charges again.\n\n* If, after seeing the cost of customs\/shipping again\/etc, you decide that it is more than you are willing to pay to have it re-shipped, and you no longer want the item(s) for that reason, you will be refunded the cost of your order MINUS the shipping costs.\n\nWILL YOU PLEASE SEND ME YOUR IMAGE&#39;S HIGH RESOLUTION FILES FOR X REASON?\nI will absolutely NOT send high resolution files to you for you to bypass having things shipped or for any other reason.  Nope nope nope.\n\nWHOLESALE AVAILABILITY\nWe are available for wholesaling. Message us for details! :)\n\nIN REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL PACKAGES CUSTOMS CHARGES, VAT, ETC.\nCustoms\/VAT\/etc. are your responsibility! They are not included in the price\/are not paid by me.  Please remember that I am not responsible for your custom&#39;s charges as they are **not** included in shipping costs.  Please consider this before placing your order!  It is your responsibility to figure out customs and things before you order.\n\nWHY IS YOUR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING SO EXPENSIVE?\nI understand that international shipping costs--before you even add in the extra customs charges, fees, etc.--are very expensive; however, I charge the absolute lowest I *possibly* can when you factor in the cost of shipping tubes, labels, labor, etc.  I&#39;m actually slightly undercharging for international shipping, so please understand that I don&#39;t like the pricey international shipping any more than you do, but unfortunately there&#39;s not much to be done about it. :( I wish it was cheaper to ship internationally, but unfortunately I am already charging the bare minimum that I can without losing much money.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1480734346,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"I will be reopening the shop sometime this week or week and a half (I have to re-order most of my inventory)--so stay tuned!
